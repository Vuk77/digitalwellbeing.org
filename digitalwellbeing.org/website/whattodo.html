        <hr class="line">
          
        <p>This means being aware of the duration and nature of their digital activities and employing strategies to maintain a healthy balance between online and offline activities. The idea is not to slide into screen activities without control but to consciously decide how much time to dedicate to these activities to protect their physical and mental well-being. </p>
        <h3>Measures:</h3>
        <p><strong>Set Screen Time Limits:</strong> You use the built-in screen time management features on your smartphone to set daily limits for specific apps or categories of apps, such as social media or games. This ensures that you don't exceed a predetermined amount of time on these activities. </p>
        <p><strong>Scheduled Breaks:</strong> Instead of mindlessly scrolling through your phone during breaks at work or school, you decide to use that time for short walks, stretching exercises, or simply to relax and clear your mind. </p>
        <p><strong>Turn Off Notifications:</strong> To avoid constant distractions, you turn off non-essential notifications on your phone. This helps you stay focused when you need to work or concentrate on other tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>Create a Digital-Free Evening:</strong> In the evenings, you establish a rule that the last hour before bedtime is dedicated to winding down without screens. You read a book, meditate, or engage in other screen-free activities to improve your sleep quality.</p>
        <p><strong>Track Your Screen Time:</strong> You regularly check the screen time usage reports on your device to see how well you're adhering to your limits and identify areas for improvement. This helps you stay accountable to your conscious screen time management goals.</p>

        <h3 class="subTitle">Digital Detox</h3>

        <hr class="line">
          
        <p>This concept refers to the deliberate decision to periodically disconnect from digital devices and the online world. It involves a planned break or withdrawal from using computers, smartphones, and other electronic devices to promote physical and mental relaxation and to recover from the constant digital connectivity. A digital detox allows individuals to reduce their dependence on digital technology and re-establish a stronger connection with the physical world.</p>
        <h3>Measures:</h3>
        <p><strong>Plan Offline Times:</strong> Schedule regular periods when you consciously go offline. This could include weekends, vacation days, or evenings when you deliberately avoid digital devices and the internet to promote physical and mental relaxation.</p>
        <p><strong>Use Airplane Mode:</strong> Activate airplane mode on your smartphone or tablet when you don't need to be reachable or when you want to focus your full attention on another activity. This disables all wireless connections.</p>
        <p><strong>Create Digital-Free Spaces:</strong> Designate areas in your home that are free from digital distractions. For example, your bedroom could be a digital-free zone to ensure better sleep quality.</p>
        <p><strong>Replace Digital Activities with Offline Activities:</strong> Instead of spending hours in front of a screen, engage in hobbies that don't require digital devices, such as reading, drawing, exercising, or spending time with friends and family.</p>
        <p><strong>Avoid the First and Last Look at Your Smartphone:</strong> Don't start your day by checking your smartphone and don't end it that way either. Keep your smartphone out of reach when you sleep and use a traditional alarm clock to wake up in the morning.</p>
